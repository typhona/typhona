- 👋 Hi, I’m @typhona
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML CSS Javascript PHP MySQL Python Django Node
- 🌱 I’m currently catching up on modern coding best practices and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything within my skill set especially if it is a cool looking/useless(or useful) visualization
- 📫 How to reach me ---- typhona @ the googles mail app........

I just downloaded, and then, nuked my entire set of repositories. 
I will be adding new ones soon and possibly reuploading the ones that I deleted.
I just wanted a clean start, that will hopefully be a little more organized and presentable
**Update** not really any more organized than the original hot mess, but I feel like I know what Im doing way more than I had previously
